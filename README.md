# Australia Bushfire - An analysis
## Event Description

* Record breaking temperatures (49.1 deg Celsius) and months of severe drought have fueled a series of massive bushfires across central and eastern Australia.
* Approximately 11 million hectares of bush, forest and parks on fire across Australia.
* New South Wales and Victoria (>5 million hectares) is the worst hit state from 2 to 11 Jan 2020.
* Northwest of Western Australia, Central Australia and Eastern Australia being the other areas among the worst hit.

## Impacts and Causes
* Forest Cover: 20% of Continent’s forest has been destroyed.
* Wildlife: 25000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island on 9 Jan.
* Environment: Fire influenced global atmosphere composition generating smoke plumes.
* Canberra measured the worst air quality index in the world.
* Smoke from Australia bushfires drifted across the Pacific Ocean, leading to hazardous air quality for New Zealand.

### Climate Pattern - Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) 
* The heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east. 
* During the positive phase of the IOD (like what happened in the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring of 2019), cooler-than-normal sea surface conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean near Java and Sumatra accompany warmer-than-normal conditions in the western tropical Indian Ocean.
* This east-west contrast in ocean conditions (a “dipole”) alters the wind, temperature, and rainfall patterns in the region, typically bringing floods to eastern Africa and droughts and bushfires to eastern Asia and Australia, among other ecological and socio-economic impacts. During the negative IOD phase, the locations of the warm/cool pattern and associated impacts reverse. 
* The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years. Elevated risk in Australia continues.

## Fire Spread region
* Fire initially broke out in the Northern of Australia.
* Eventually spread along the coastal region and some part of the central region.
* Maximum fire intensity was observed in the south east region.

## Conclusions
* Australia’s climate has warmed by over 1 °C since 1960. Australia experienced its hottest year on record in 2019, with average temperatures 1.52 deg Celcius above the 1961-1990 average.
* Visualisations depict that the main regions fire spread in Australia is closely related to regions land temperature and rainfall pattern.
* Among the different machine learning models, prediction using Ridge regression has more reliable results.
* Using Ridge, the temperature difference between 1990 and 2019 is around 0.5 deg Celsius, while the difference increases to 0.78 and 1.27 deg Celsius for years 2030 and 2050 respectively.
